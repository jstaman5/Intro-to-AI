CS 423: Project 1

How to run code:
python main.py


This project reads in a csv file named "applicants.csv" that has 6 test scores for each applicant, 5 CS classes and 1 non-CS class.
The program sends the applicants' test scores to 4 different analyze applicant functions. 
The first function tests if applicants have an average above 85.
The second function tests whether the applicants have no grade below 65.
The third function tests if they have at least 4 grades above 85.
The fourth function tests if they have an average above 85 in their 5 CS courses.

If an applicant passes all 4 functions, then they receive an "ACCEPT".
If they do not pass all 4, then they receive a "REJECT".
